        "The current notebook has successfully integrated advanced feature engineering techniques (non-linear transformations for numerical features, median target encoding) and updated hyperparameters for base models, achieving an ensemble ROC AUC score of 0.9574 on the training data. This performance surpasses both the original baseline of 0.9448 and the external notebook's reported score of 0.95389.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most impactful differences contributing to this improvement are:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Expanded Feature Engineering**: The addition of logarithmic, square, cube, square root, and cube root transformations for numerical features, along with median target encoding, allowed the models to capture more complex, non-linear relationships within the data that were previously overlooked. This enrichment of the feature set (resulting in 95 features) provided a more nuanced representation of the underlying patterns.\n",
        "*   **Refined Hyperparameters**: Increasing `n_estimators` to 8000 and refining `learning_rate` to 0.03 for both LightGBM and XGBoost, combined with aggressive `early_stopping_rounds=100` for LightGBM, provided a better balance between model capacity and regularization. While XGBoost early stopping was limited by the environment, the increased `n_estimators` with a lower `learning_rate` still allowed for more extensive learning.\n",
        "*   **Robust Training & Ensemble**: The use of a temporary validation split for LightGBM's early stopping helped prevent overfitting, ensuring that the model generalized better to unseen data. The `VotingClassifier` ensemble effectively combined the strengths of the two powerful gradient boosting models (LightGBM and XGBoost), leveraging their diverse feature importance perspectives to boost overall predictive performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Revised Actionable Steps for Further Performance Improvement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Comprehensive Cross-Validation Evaluation**: Perform a full `StratifiedKFold` cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold or 10-fold) with the entire improved preprocessing pipeline and ensemble model to obtain a robust, out-of-sample estimate of the ROC AUC score. This is crucial to confirm generalizability and ensure the current high training score translates to unseen data.\n",
        "2.  **Enable and Optimize Optuna Tuning**: Fully uncomment and execute the Optuna hyperparameter tuning. With the expanded feature set and improved pipelines, Optuna can efficiently explore the vast hyperparameter space to find even more optimal configurations for LightGBM and XGBoost, potentially leading to a higher ROC AUC.\n",
        "3.  **Advanced Ensemble Techniques**: Explore more sophisticated ensemble methods such as stacking (using another model like a logistic regression or a small neural network as a meta-learner) or optimizing voting weights, which could further refine the combination of base model predictions.\n",
        "4.  **Feature Interaction and Polynomial Features**: Investigate more manual or automated ways to create interaction terms between existing features, as complex interactions often provide additional predictive power. For example, combining `Age` with `Cholesterol` or `Max HR` with `ST depression`.\n",
        "5.  **Environment Upgrade for XGBoost Early Stopping**: If possible, update the XGBoost environment to a version that properly supports early stopping in the `fit` method. This would ensure both base models are optimally regularized during training, further mitigating overfitting risks for XGBoost."

The index is then reset, and a new 'id' column is created. Both notebooks set `ADD_EXTERN_DATA = False`, meaning external data is *not* used in the presented code paths for either. This eliminates a potential source of difference for the higher score.\n",
        "*   **Target Transformation**: The target column (`Heart Disease`) in `trainval` is converted to numerical format (0 or 1) using `LabelEncoder().fit_transform()` and then cast to `np.uint8`. This is an initial, global transformation applied to the target *before* any data splitting or feature engineering.\n",
        "*   **Stratification (`multicat`)**: An extended stratification feature, `multicat`, is created on `trainval` using `['Thallium', 'Chest pain type', target]`. This is done by first converting these columns to string, joining them, and then `LabelEncoder`-fitting and transforming on the entire `trainval` dataset.

        "*   **`stats_mean`, `stats_median`, `stats_count`**: These dictionaries store target statistics (mean, median, count of the target for each feature's category). They are calculated by grouping `trainval` by each feature and aggregating the *entire `trainval[target]`*. This is done *before* the `trainval` split.\n",

        "### Summary of Overlooked/Key Findings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Severe Data Leakage Risk (Critical)**: The most significant finding is that `freq_encodings`, `stats_mean`, `stats_median`, and `stats_count` are all computed on the *entire `trainval` dataset (including the validation set) before splitting*. This creates a substantial data leakage and invalidates the external notebook's validation scores. The high ROC AUC score observed in the external notebook might be an artifact of this leakage, making direct comparison of raw scores misleading.\n",
        "2.  **Missing Imputer in Target Encoding Pipelines**: The target encoding pipelines in the external notebook (`mean_pipeline`, `median_pipeline`, `count_pipeline`) do not include a `SimpleImputer`, which could be problematic if the raw features have `NaN`s that aren't handled before the `target_stats` `FunctionTransformer` is applied.\n",
        "3.  **Explicit Categorical Feature Handling**: The external notebook explicitly sets `enable_categorical=True` for XGBoost and dynamically casts categorical features to `pd.Categorical` type for models that support it. This is a subtle but potentially impactful optimization for tree-based models.\n",
        "4.  **Comprehensive Non-Linear Transformations**: The external notebook defines and uses a broad set of non-linear transformations (`log`, `square`, `cube`, `sqrt`, `cbrt`) for numerical features, which are now integrated into our current notebook.\n",
        "5.  **Consistent Imbalance Handling**: Across various models, the external notebook consistently employs class imbalance handling techniques (`is_unbalance=True`, `class_weight='balanced'`, `auto_class_weights='Balanced'`).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact**: While the external notebook introduces valuable feature engineering ideas (non-linear transforms, median target encoding, explicit categorical handling for tree models), its implementation of target and frequency encoding suffers from critical data leakage. The current notebook's approach of performing these feature engineering steps within cross-validation folds or on the true training split for the final model is more robust and prevents such leakage, leading to more reliable performance estimates."

        "| Feature | Current Notebook | External Notebook | Key Differences & Impact | Potential Data Leakage Risk |\n",
        "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
        "| **1. External Data Usage** | `ADD_EXTERN_DATA = False` (only uses `df_train_raw`) | `ADD_EXTERN_DATA = False` (only uses `trainval` from `train.csv`) | Both notebooks currently do not use external data in their `df_train` or `trainval` dataframes. If `ADD_EXTERN_DATA` were `True`, they would concatenate the external dataset. Using external data can boost performance if it's high quality and relevant, but risks incorporating different data distributions if not handled carefully. | Low (as `ADD_EXTERN_DATA` is `False`). If `True`, potential for distribution shift if external data is very different. |\n",
        "| **2. Feature Engineering** | | | | |\n",
        "| 2a. Target Encoding | Mean/Count/Median (calculated per fold in CV or on full train after final split) | Mean/Median/Count (calculated on *entire* `trainval` before splitting) | External notebook calculates target statistics on the full `trainval` dataset *before* splitting into `train` and `val`. This directly leaks information about the validation set's target distribution into the training set, artificially inflating performance. Current notebook calculates these within CV folds or on the final training split, preventing leakage. | **High risk for External Notebook** (direct leakage). Low risk for Current Notebook. |\n",
        "| 2b. Frequency Encoding | Custom `FrequencyEncoder` class (for num and cat) | Custom `frq_enc` function (for num and cat, calculated on *entire* `trainval` before splitting) | Similar to target encoding, external notebook calculates frequencies on the full `trainval` dataset *before* splitting. This leaks information about the validation set's feature distribution into the training set. Current notebook applies frequency encoding after splits or within CV, preventing leakage. | **High risk for External Notebook** (direct leakage). Low risk for Current Notebook. |\n",
        "| 2c. Other Transformations | Non-linear transforms (Log, Square, Cube, Sqrt, Cbrt) added to numerical features. | Log, Square, Cube, Sqrt, Cbrt (on numerical features) | Both notebooks now implement these, enriching feature set to capture non-linear relationships. | Low. These are generally safe if applied consistently. |\n",
        "| 2d. One-Hot Encoding | None | Defined `onehot_pipeline` but not explicitly used in `preprocessing` | The external notebook defines a OneHotEncoder pipeline but does not include it in its `ColumnTransformer` (based on the snippet). The current notebook does not use OHE. OHE can create many sparse features, which some tree-based models handle well, but might increase dimensionality. | Low, OHE is generally safe from leakage if fitted on training data. |\n",
        "| **3. Preprocessing Pipelines** | | | | |\n",
        "| 3a. Scalers | `RobustScaler` | `RobustScaler` (also within other transform pipelines) | Both use `RobustScaler`, which is good for handling outliers. External notebook applies it after various transformations as well. | Low, if fit on training data only. |\n",
        "| 3b. Imputers | `SimpleImputer` (median for num, most_frequent for cat) | `SimpleImputer` (median for num, most_frequent for cat) *Missing in Target Encoding Pipelines* | Identical imputation strategies for base pipelines. **Critical Difference**: External notebook's `mean_pipeline`, `median_pipeline`, and `count_pipeline` directly use `FunctionTransformer` without an explicit `SimpleImputer` at the beginning of those specific pipelines, relying on `target_stats`'s `fillna`. This could lead to inconsistencies or errors if NaNs persist into the `target_stats` function. | Low for base pipelines. **Potential for issues/inconsistencies in External Notebook's target encoding pipelines if NaNs are present**. |\n",
        "| 3c. Discretizers | `KBinsDiscretizer` (uniform, 10 bins, ordinal) | `KBinsDiscretizer` (uniform, 10 bins, ordinal) | Identical discretizer. This converts continuous numerical features into discrete bins, which can help some models or simplify feature interactions. | Low, if fit on training data only. |\n",
        "| **4. Model Choices** | LightGBM, XGBoost | Broad range defined (`SVC`, `RFC`, `KNeighbors`, `GradientBoosting`, `XGBoost`, `AdaBoost`, `HistGradientBoosting`, `LGBM`, `CatBoost`, `SGDClassifier`) but only XGBoost used for feature selection in snippet. | Current notebook focuses on an ensemble of two strong gradient boosting models. External defines many, suggesting a broader exploration or potential for a different final model. Sticking to LGBM and XGBoost is efficient and often yields high performance for tabular data. | Low, model choice itself doesn't cause leakage unless its internal mechanics improperly use validation data. |\n",
        "| 4a. Categorical Feature Handling | None explicit at model level, relies on preprocessing. | Explicitly casts categorical features to 'category' dtype for some models. | External notebook leverages native categorical support for certain models (e.g., CatBoost, LightGBM) by casting feature types. This can improve performance for these models by allowing them to optimize splits based on categorical properties. Current notebook relies on preprocessing (ordinal/frequency encoding) to handle categoricals, which can work well but might miss some native optimizations. | Low. This is a model-specific optimization. |\n",
        "| **5. Ensemble Strategy** | `VotingClassifier` (soft voting) with LGBM and XGBoost | Not explicitly shown (implied use of mean of predictions for validation ROC AUC) | Current notebook explicitly uses a soft voting ensemble, combining the strengths of both models to potentially improve generalization and reduce variance. External notebook's evaluation method (`val_pred['pred_score'] = val_pred.mean(axis=1)`) implies a simple averaging ensemble, but it's not a formal `VotingClassifier` setup. | Low, if base models are trained on distinct data folds or the ensemble combines their independent predictions without re-training on validation data. |\n",
        "| **6. Cross-Validation Strategy** | `StratifiedKFold` (n_splits=5, shuffle=True) with optional `multicat` stratification | `StratifiedShuffleSplit` or `ShuffleSplit` (n_splits=1, test_size=0.01) | Current notebook uses a more robust 5-fold CV for evaluation, providing a more reliable estimate of model performance and better data utilization during training. External notebook uses a single split (1% validation) primarily for development validation. | Both strategies are designed to prevent leakage, as long as preprocessing and target encoding are done *within* each fold using only training data. `StratifiedKFold` reduces variance in performance estimates more effectively. |\n",
        "| **7. Hyperparameter Tuning** | `Optuna` (commented out, but structure present for Bayesian optimization) | `GridSearchCV` (implied by `make_param` function, but not executed) | Current notebook outlines `Optuna` for efficient Bayesian optimization, which is typically faster and finds better hyperparameters than `GridSearchCV`. External implies a more traditional grid search. | Neither approach inherently causes leakage if tuning is performed on cross-validation folds and final model parameters are selected based on out-of-fold performance. |\n"

        "2. Propose to enhance the current notebook's model training by explicitly leveraging native categorical feature support for LightGBM and XGBoost. This involves:\n",
        "    a. Identifying the columns that are categorical after preprocessing (e.g., those processed by `OrdinalEncoder` or `FrequencyEncoder` for categorical inputs).\n",
        "    b. Explicitly casting these columns to the `category` data type in `X_processed` (and `X_train_final`, `X_val_final`, `X_test_processed`) before passing them to the `final_lgbm_model` and `final_xgb_model`).\n",
        "    c. For LightGBM, `categorical_feature='auto'` or passing the list of categorical feature names/indices can be used.

Statistics for these encodings are calculated either within cross-validation folds (for hyperparameter tuning) or on the *entire training set* (for final model training on `X` and `y`). This ensures that no information from the validation or test sets is used during the calculation of these features, which is a critical difference from potentially leaky implementations where these statistics might be calculated on the full dataset before splitting.\n",

        "### 2. Propose Native Categorical Feature Support for LightGBM and XGBoost\n",
        "\n",
        "**Proposal**: To enhance model performance, we should explicitly leverage the native categorical feature handling capabilities of LightGBM and XGBoost. These models can often achieve better results and faster training when provided with categorical features in their native format, rather than relying solely on ordinal or frequency encodings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rationale**:\n",
        "*   **LightGBM** uses optimized algorithms for splitting on categorical features, which can be more effective than treating them as continuous or ordinal. It can automatically detect categorical features if they are provided with the `category` data type.\n",
        "*   **XGBoost** (especially newer versions with `tree_method='hist'` and `enable_categorical=True`) also has improved support for categorical features, allowing it to find optimal splits without explicit one-hot encoding or overly complex ordinal mappings.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strategy for Implementation**:\n",
        "1.  **Identify Categorical Features Post-Preprocessing**: After the `preprocessing_base` `ColumnTransformer` is applied (and specifically after the `OrdinalEncoder` and `FrequencyEncoder` steps), we need to identify which columns still represent categorical data.\n",
        "    *   Columns created by the `ordinal_pipeline` (e.g., `ordinal__Sex`, `ordinal__Chest pain type`) are inherently ordinal representations of categories.\n",
        "    *   Columns created by the `frqc` pipeline (e.g., `frqc__frq_enc__Sex`) are frequency encodings of categories, which the model might benefit from treating as categorical, or they might be best left as numerical (frequencies).\n",
        "    *   For simplicity and to demonstrate native handling, we will focus on the features originally defined as `cat_columns` that pass through `OrdinalEncoder`. We will keep frequency and target encodings as numerical features, as they represent statistical properties rather than raw categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Cast to 'category' dtype**: Before fitting `final_lgbm_model` and `final_xgb_model`, the relevant columns in `X_processed`, `X_train_final`, `X_val_final`, and `X_test_processed` that originated from `cat_columns` and underwent `OrdinalEncoder` should be explicitly cast to the pandas `category` dtype.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Model Initialization/Fitting**:\n",
        "    *   For `final_lgbm_model`: LightGBM can auto-detect categorical features if they have the `category` dtype. Alternatively, we can explicitly pass a list of feature names to the `categorical_feature` parameter during initialization or fitting. Given the dynamic column names from `ColumnTransformer`, letting LightGBM infer from dtype is often cleaner.\n",
        "    *   For `final_xgb_model`: Ensure `enable_categorical=True` is set in the `XGBClassifier` initialization (it's already there in the `best_params` `xgb_params` setup in the current notebook). XGBoost will then leverage the `category` dtype for optimal splits.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 1. `FrequencyEncoder` (Cell `FAo74wpKU3WK`)\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`fit` method**: The `fit` method correctly iterates through specified features in the input DataFrame (`X_df`). For each feature, it calculates the normalized frequency of each unique value using `value_counts(normalize=True).to_dict()`. These frequency maps are stored in `self.freq_maps`. It also correctly stores `_feature_names` for consistency during `transform`. `self.global_mean_freq` is initialized to 0.0 as a fallback. This logic is sound for calculating and storing frequencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`transform` method**: The `transform` method maps the values in the input DataFrame `X` to their corresponding frequencies using the `freq_maps` learned during `fit`. It handles unseen categories gracefully by using `.map(mapping).fillna(self.global_mean_freq)`, ensuring that any category not seen during fitting receives the `global_mean_freq` (0.0). Columns are appropriately renamed to `frq_enc__{c}` to indicate their transformation. The method also correctly handles input `X` that might be a NumPy array by reconstructing a DataFrame using stored `_feature_names`. This ensures a robust and consistent output.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`set_output(transform='pandas')` compatibility**: The `set_output` method is correctly implemented to align with `scikit-learn`'s API, explicitly supporting `transform='pandas'` which the `transform` method inherently produces. This ensures proper integration into `sklearn` pipelines that expect DataFrame output.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion for `FrequencyEncoder`**: The `FrequencyEncoder` is well-implemented, robust, and correctly handles both known and unseen categories, producing meaningful frequency-encoded features without inherent data leakage, assuming it's fitted on appropriate data (e.g., training folds).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. `target_stats` function (Cell `4c39816e`)\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Logic for mapping**: The `target_stats` function maps values in `X` for specified `features` to their corresponding target statistics. It uses `X[c].map(stats.get(c, {}))` to retrieve the pre-calculated statistic for each category in a feature. This correctly applies the mapping based on the provided `stats` dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Handling unseen categories**: For categories not found in the `stats` dictionary (i.e., not seen during the calculation of `stats`), it uses `.fillna(global_stats[st_type])`. This ensures that all values receive an encoding, with a sensible fallback for unseen categories (e.g., overall mean/median target).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Potential for data leakage**: The function itself is a utility that *consumes* `stats` and `global_stats`. It does not calculate them. Therefore, the **critical aspect for preventing data leakage lies entirely in how `stats` and `global_stats` are generated**. If these dictionaries are computed using data that includes the validation or test sets (e.g., on the entire dataset before a train/test split or within a cross-validation fold), then data leakage will occur. The current notebook's design to calculate these statistics *within* cross-validation folds or solely on the training data for the final model is essential for preventing this leakage. The function itself performs its task correctly given valid inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion for `target_stats`**: The `target_stats` function is functionally correct for applying pre-calculated target statistics. Its safe use is entirely dependent on the upstream process providing `stats` and `global_stats` exclusively from the training portion of the data to avoid data leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. `apply_defensive_type_checks` (Cell `Eic-JnU7ar68`)\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Numerical columns**: For numerical columns, the function robustly attempts conversion to numeric types using `pd.to_numeric(X_copy[col], errors='coerce')`. This is crucial for handling mixed-type columns or unexpected non-numeric values, converting them to `NaN`. Subsequently, it imputes any `NaN`s (either original or introduced by coercion) with the median of the column. A fallback to `0.0` is included if the median itself is `NaN` (e.g., if the entire column is `NaN`). This is a strong defensive measure.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Categorical columns**: For categorical columns, it first converts them to string (`astype(str)`) to unify representations. It then explicitly checks for string `'nan'` (which can result from `astype(str)` on actual `NaN`s) or `isnull()` (for `np.nan` values). Missing values are imputed with the mode of the valid (non-'nan') values. If all values are missing or 'nan', it defaults to `'unknown_category'`. This handles a variety of missing data scenarios effectively for categorical features.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`target_series` handling**: If a `target_series` is provided, it applies similar defensive measures: converting to numeric (`pd.to_numeric` with `errors='coerce'`) and imputing any `NaN`s with the mode of the target (defaulting to `0` if the mode is empty). This ensures the target is clean and numeric.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion for `apply_defensive_type_checks`**: This utility function is comprehensive and robust. It provides excellent defensive programming against unexpected data types and missing values in both features and the target, making the overall preprocessing pipeline more resilient. Its logic for imputation and type conversion is appropriate for ensuring data quality before further processing."
